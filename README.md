## HOW TO USE
When opening the application, a login screen is displayed with a 'remember' option to keep the session open. Users can log out and will need to log back in. In the current version, user registration is not implemented; only user 'Olivia' with password '1234Abc' is available.

On the main screen, a search engine returns a list of recipes from an external API. Users can mark recipes as favorites, view them in the favorites section, and remove them as needed. Recipes can also be shared outside the app, such as by email.

The app also has welcome notifications upon login.
